# Buffons Needle Experiment

Buffon’s Needle Experiment (1) was described in the 18th Century as a method to estimate π. It is conducted by dropping a specified number (n) of ‘needles’ (or ‘sticks’) of length l onto a surface with parallel lines separated by a distance, t (where t > l) and then counting the number (c) of needles that cross one of the lines. This enables the probability c/n to be determined. It has been shown that this probability is equal to 2l/tπ, which, when rearranged, provides the estimate of π as 2ln/tc. The target population involves all possible drops of needles on a surface with parallel lines. The experimental unit is each iteration of dropping needles of length l onto a surface with parallel lines separated by a distance, t. The objective of the proposed experiment is to examine if the value of n or the ratio of l:t affects the estimation of the probability c/n, and hence π. The study will explore deeper into what variables in the experiment affect the estimation of π.

# Analysis 
The primary data analysis will be a two-way analysis of variance. A secondary analysis will be pairwise comparisons of the four treatment groups’ variances be to estimate π. These will be carried out using F tests with each α level being adjusted by Holm’s procedure (2). An alpha level of 0.05 will be used.
